ðŸ«€Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the Heart Failure Prediction project, conducted as part of the Patient Data Understanding course at Rowan University during the Masterâ€™s in Data Science program. The project leverages machine learning to predict heart disease occurrences, exploring data-driven insights for early detection and preventive care.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights

ðŸ“Š Data Overview

Dataset: Heart Failure Prediction Dataset, sourced from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Observations: 918 entries with 12 features, combining data from 5 key heart disease datasets.
Target Variable: Binary classification of HeartDisease (presence or absence).

ðŸ›  Key Techniques

Data Preprocessing:
Label encoding for categorical data.
Standard scaling to ensure feature normalization.
Outlier detection to improve data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualized key factors like ST_Slope, ChestPainType, and Oldpeak using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Uncovered demographic insights, such as age distribution and gender dominance in heart disease cases.

Modeling:

Built four classification models:
Random Forest (85% accuracy)
Decision Tree (84% accuracy)
K-Nearest Neighbors (81% accuracy)
Logistic Regression (81% accuracy)
Identified Random Forest as the best-performing model with feature importance analysis.

ðŸŒŸ Impactful Insights

Key Features Influencing Predictions:
ST_Slope, ChestPainType, and Oldpeak were identified as the most impactful predictors.

Balanced Dataset: The dataset exhibited a nearly even distribution of positive and negative heart disease cases, enhancing prediction reliability.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
Languages & Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Data Sources: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository
